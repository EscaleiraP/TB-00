# Blockchain Usage Doctrine

**Purpose:**  
Define how and why we use blockchain technology solely for timestamping and certification—not for trading or custody.

## Principles

1. **Proof of Existence**  
   Store only hashes of metadata on‐chain to prove a snapshot in time.  
2. **Minimal On‐chain Footprint**  
   No token transfers, no custody. Just a single “anchor” transaction.  
3. **Gas Efficiency**  
   Batch or layer proofs to reduce on‐chain volume and cost.  
4. **Verifiability**  
   Any party can independently verify the on‐chain record against Vault metadata.

## Outcomes

- Immutable, publicly verifiable proof of authorship.  
- Efficient, low-cost chain interactions.  
- Full off-chain storage of heavy data, on‐chain security for hashes.
