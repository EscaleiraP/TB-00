# Bridge Protection Doctrine

**Purpose:**  
Define why we avoid bridging assets between chains, and instead use the Vault as a guarded anchor point.

## Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**  
   Avoid cross‐chain ambiguity by anchoring proofs in one immutable ledger (the Vault).  
2. **Security over Exposure**  
   Each bridge adds risk. We protect author rights by minimizing external dependencies.  
3. **Temporal Anchoring**  
   The Vault records a timestamped proof; bridging would re-timestamp and dilute provenance.  
4. **Controlled Access**  
   Only Vault’s guardians can certify or reveal proofs, ensuring no unauthorized linkage.

## Outcomes

- Clear, unbroken lineage of authorship.  
- No reliance on external chain bridges or transient protocols.  
- Simplified audit and dispute resolution.
