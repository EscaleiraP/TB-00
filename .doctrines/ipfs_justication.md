# IPFS Justification Doctrine

**Purpose:**  
Explain why IPFS is our chosen storage layer for metadata and assets.

## Principles

1. **Content Addressing**  
   Files are retrieved by hash (CID), ensuring integrity.  
2. **Decentralized Availability**  
   No single point of failure; community nodes can serve Vault data.  
3. **Open Ecosystem**  
   Compatible with multiple pinning services (Web3.Storage, Pinata).  
4. **Immutability**  
   Once published, a CID always resolves to the same content.

## Outcomes

- Reliable, tamper-proof asset and metadata storage.  
- Interoperable with existing IPFS infrastructure.  
- Simplified audit: a CID always equals a single, verifiable object.
